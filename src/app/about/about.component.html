  <p>
    FeedGist is developed by Bartek Mis, head of development as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biggerpicture.agency">Bigger Picture</a>, a digital design agency in the UK and Poland. Originally intended as a Progressive Web App demo, weâ€™ve decided to release it to the public to see how useful people find it. Enjoy!
